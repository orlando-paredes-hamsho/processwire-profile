Update #20 - 2012/02/05

- Various minor bugfixes and optimizations
- Add new checkbox on Settings tab enabling you to disable session tracking and
  CSRF protection. This is useful if you want to cache your forms with ProCache
  or if you want to send form submissions to a 3rd party script. 
- Optimizations and improvements to the 'plain2' theme

Update #19 - 2012/12/06

- Fix bug with file uploads that prevented them from working when the files field
  was placed in a Fieldset. Also made the mail() function recognize the $config
  variable: $config->phpMailAdditionalParameters, where you may specify additional
  parameters to FormBuilder's usage of PHP's mail() function, if necessary. This
  would be set from your /site/config.php. 

Update #18 - 2012/11/22

- Add support for form-level access control. To enable, check the Access Control box
  on your Modules > Form Builder module config screen. This update also installs a
  permission called form-builder-add, which is the permission you would assign to 
  roles you want to be allowed to add new forms. 

Update #17 - 2012/11/12

- Addition of File Inputfield, specific to use with Form Builder. Various other minor
  bugfixes and tweaks were made as well. 

Update #16 - 2012/10/10
=======================

- Add new option that lets the form be preset with values from GET variables. To enable
  check the box under the 'settings' tab of your form. Once you do that, any GET variables
  present that carry the same name as a form field will be populated to the form. This 
  works with all embed methods and FormBuilder takes care of delivering the data to the
  embed methods that use iframes.

Update #15 - 2012/10/05
=======================

- Add new auto-responder feature

Update #14 - 2012/10/03
=======================

- Add new form submission action: Save to ProcessWire Pages
- Add new 'Actions' and 'Output' tabs in the form admin screen
- Add new CSV delimiter option to the Form Builder config
- Various minor bug fixes 

Update #13 - 2012/09/23
=======================

- Add support for a 'notes' field that appears below the input. This is essentially the same 
  as the 'description' field, except that it appears below, rather than above, the input. 
  You'll see this 'notes' field used throughout ProcessWire already, so this just lets Form 
  Builder use this existing feature.

- Updated the 'Markup' inputfield (InputfieldMarkup) to be usable with Form Builder. To take 
  advantage of this, you'll have to grab the latest ProcessWire core (2.2.9). If you don't 
  have 'Markup' listed as an input type when creating a field in Form Builder, then go to the 
  module settings and add it to the list of allowed inputs.

Update #12 - 2012/09/20
=======================

- Correct issue with possible field name/form setting clashes (i.e. naming a field 'honeypot')

Update #11 - 2012/09/20
=======================

- Correct issues with single Checkbox fields.
- Updated required ProcessWire version to 2.2.8
- Removed redundant error messages from the top of a failed form submission.

Update #10 - 2012/09/18
=======================
	
- First release of Form Builder
