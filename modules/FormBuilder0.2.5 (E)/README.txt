ProcessWire Form Builder
========================

Copyright (C) 2015 by Ryan Cramer Design, LLC

This is a commercial module for ProcessWire that provides the capability to build, edit 
and embed forms on your ProcessWire-powered web site. 


PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE
========================

This service/software is authorized for use only for the site(s) it was purchased for. 
It should not be distributed beyond the site(s) you registered it for, except for staging 
and/or development servers related to the site. 

You may purchase a product key at: http://processwire.com/FormBuilder/


HOW TO INSTALL
==============

1. Form Builder requires ProcessWire 2.4 or newer. Make sure you update your ProcessWire
version before installing Form Builder.

2. Unzip and place the files in /site/modules/FormBuilder/. 

3. In the ProcessWire admin, click to Modules > Refresh (or "Check for new modules")

4. Click install for Form Builder. 

5. If instructed to, copy /site/modules/FormBuilder/form-builder.php to
   /site/templates/form-builder.php

6. Enter your product key on the Form Builder module configuration screen and submit.

7. Review the configuration options and adjust as necessary, then submit.

8. Go to the Setup menu in your ProcessWire admin and click on Forms to begin using
   Form Builder! 


CUSTOM THEMES AND FRAMEWORKS
=============================

Form Builder comes with several different themes and frameworks that can be selected 
for styling any given form. These are located in: 

/site/modules/FormBuilder/frameworks/ (CSS frameworks)
/site/modules/FormBuilder/themes/ (jQuery UI themes)

If you would like to customize existing frameworks, themes, add frameworks/themes, or 
remove them, we recommend copying the contents of one of the directories above to 
the following location: 

   /site/templates/FormBuilder/frameworks/
   /site/templates/FormBuilder/themes/

You will need to create both the "FormBuilder" and "frameworks" and/or "themes" parts 
of that directory. You may copy all the frameworks and themes if you want to, or just 
specific ones. You may also add new ones. 

Once in place, Form Builder will use your custom directory rather than the one
it comes with. The benefit of this is that your custom frameworks/themes directories 
won't get overwritten during Form Builder upgrades. 

For more about creating Form Builder themes, see our Form Builder support board at
https://processwire.com/talk/forum/18-form-builder-support/


UPGRADES
========

Upgrades are made available through the ProcessWire Form Builder support forum at
http://processwire.com/talk/. To install an upgrade do the following:

1. If you have customized any of the themes and they are located in the Form Builder
   modules directory, we recommend following the instructions under the Custom Themes 
   section of this document first. 

2. Replace the entire contents of your /site/modules/FormBuilder/ directory with 
   the contents of the new Form Builder zip file. 

3. Replace your /site/templates/form-builder.php with the new one in 
   /site/modules/FormBuilder/form-builder.php

Your Form Builder should now be upgraded.
