This service/software is authorized for use only for the sites it was

ABOUT LISTER PRO
================

ListerPro enables you to find, filter, list and manipulate pages based 
on any of their properties. It presents an AJAX-driven table of 
matching pages and you have full, dynamic control over what columns 
are displayed in the table, and their order. Unlike the regular Lister, 
ListerPro enables you to create your own custom Listers, perform 
manipulations on pages, customize to your heart's desire, and much 
more. ListerPro is a truly unique, powerful and easy-to-use tool that 
will significantly enhance the way you work with ProcessWire.

REQUIREMENTS
============

ProcessWire 2.5.0 or newer. 


HOW TO INSTALL LISTER PRO
=========================

The ZIP file that this module comes in can be uploaded directly to
your admin in Modules > New > Upload. If your modules file system is
not writable, you can also install it this way: 

1. Copy the ListerPro files into this directory:
   /site/modules/ProcessPageListerPro/

2. In your ProcessWire admin, go to Modules and "Refresh".

3. Click "Install" for the ListerPro (ProcessPageListerPro) module.

Following installaton, enter your product key in the field provided 
and 'submit'. If you have any trouble getting your product key to 
validate just send a PM to ryan in the forums at 
http://processwire.com/talk/ or email ryan@processwire.com. 

ListerPro immediately replaces your Pages > Find screen, as well as
your Access > Users screen. But where ListerPro really gets fun is
in creating your own Listers. Continue to the next section for 
instructions on how to do this. 


HOW TO ADD A NEW LISTER
=======================

1. In your admin, go to Pages > Find (or any existing Lister). 

2. Click the Config tab. Scroll to the bottom and click the 
   "Add a NEW Lister" field. 

3. Type in the name for the new Lister and click Save. Your new Lister 
   is created.

Following the above 3 steps, you are on the configuration screen for the new 
Lister. Configure it as you'd like and hit Save. You will see the link to 
your new Lister in the top navigation under Pages > [your Lister's title].

If you want to move your new Lister somewhere else: Click Pages in the top 
navigation and then click "Admin" then "Pages" in the tree. You will see your 
Lister page there. Click it and select "Move" and then drag it wherever
you'd like in your admin. Do not move it out of the admin. 


HOW TO ADD A LISTER PRO ACTION
==============================

ListerPro comes with several ready-to-use actions. You may also download 
additional actions from the ListerPro support board. ListerPro actions are 
actually just ProcessWire page actions, which is a predefined module type 
in ProcessWire. These actions are ProcessWire modules like any other. 
Install them the same way you would any other module.

Once installed, the actions will show up on all of your ListerPro "Config" 
screens under the "What actions do you want to allow" section. Check the 
box next to any actions you want to allow with each Lister.

Most actions also come with their own permission that the user needs to 
have in order to execute the action. The actions table on the Config 
screen will tell you what permission is required. What this means is 
simply that the user must have that permission checked in one of their 
roles before the action will be available to them. However, because of 
the inherent power (and thus potential danger) in most page actions, 
you may want to limit these actions to superusers. 


UPGRADES
========

Upgrades are made available through the ProcessWire ListerPro support
board at http://processwire.com/talk/. If you can't see the support board
there, please email ryan@processwire.com or send a PM to ryan from the
ProcessWire forums.

To install an upgrade you would typically just replace the old files
with the new. However, there may be more to it, depending on the version.
Always follow any instructions provided with the upgrade version in
the support board.
